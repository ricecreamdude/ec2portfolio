Hello,

I'm Joshua Ho, a web developer based in Seattle, Washington.  

I've been building websites for the past year and a half, creating websites for
clients using technologies like WordPress and the MEAN technology stack.

I have a Management Information Systems degree from Western Washington University
and I've completed the Code Fellows' JavaScript 401 Boot Camp.
