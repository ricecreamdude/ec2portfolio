# Amazon EC2 Portfolio
Hello,

I'm Joshua Ho, a web developer based in Seattle, Washington.  This web
application is used to catalog my work as a developer and to learn how to host
an application using Amazon's EC2 hosting technologies.

I've been building websites for the past year and a half, creating websites for
clients using technologies like WordPress and the MEAN technology stack. I have
a business-focused Management Information Systems degree from Western Washington
University and I've completed the Code Fellows' JavaScript 401 Bootcamp.

Feel free to contact me at any time.
